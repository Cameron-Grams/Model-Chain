# The Model Chain Project

[Live Site](https://square-one-blockchain.xyz)

This is a project I built implementing an in-browser blockchain to demonstrate some of the basic concepts used today.  The goal was to have a single stop for family and friends to go and find an explanation and a chance to actually see what was involved.
